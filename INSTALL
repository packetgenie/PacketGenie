Required dependency:
 - Boost C++ libraries: regex, program_options, lexical_cast


How to get/install Boost:
 Option 1.
 - Get Boost library from: http://www.boost.org/
   Latest is preferred, but can support boost_1.41.
   Install it in your system. (/usr/lib64/boost)
   ex.) You are running this on one of the batman servers.
   
 Option 2.
 - Alternatively, you can take the include.tar file in the ariel folder
   /net/vips/projects/ariel/include.tar and put the include/ folder
   in the top-level directory. 
   This is a cut-down version of the 
   boost library with only the code required for the simulator.

=== Building the Code ===
1) Open Makefile
2) If you already have an existing boost library installed in your 
   machine, uncomment this part of the Makefile:
            BOOST_FLAG = -lboost
            BOOST_LINK = -lboost_program_options -lboost_regex
   OR. if you chose to install boost library in a local directory,
       uncomment this part. Make sure BOOSTDIR points to where your
       boost library is located.
            BOOSTDIR   = include/boost_1_56_0
            BOOSTLIB   = $(BOOSTDIR)/stage/lib
            BOOST_LINK = $(BOOSTLIB)/libboost_program_options.a \
  					             $(BOOSTLIB)/libboost_regex.a
3) Close Makefile
4) Run make
5) Executable will be in bin/
